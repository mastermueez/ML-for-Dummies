# ML for Dummies
Run a bunch of machine learning algorithms on any CSV file as well as generate some data visualisations without writing any code. To start, execute the **application.py** file. Here's a quick [demo](https://youtu.be/fd6efh9Zwoc).

## Dependencies Required
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)
* [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html)


## Fields
![Main Window:](https://github.com/mastermueez/ML-for-Dummies/blob/master/Pics/MainWindow.png)
* **Target class**: This is the class that you want to predict. This needs to be specified before you open your file.
*  **Null % at which columns are dropped**: If you enter a value of say, 60 here, any column in your dataset with 60% or more of its values missing will be dropped automatically. Because it is better to drop that column entirely than drop/alter 60% or more of your datasetâ€™s rows
* **Max label count for One Hot Encoding**: This determines the threshold for one hot encoding. Suppose you enter a value of 3 and a column (Gender) in your dataset has three unique values (Male, Female, Other), then that column will be one hot encoded. Also, any column (e.g: Type) with less than three unique values (e.g: Free, Paid) will be one hot encoded. All other columns (with unique values > threshold set) will be label encoded. This [article](http://pbpython.com/categorical-encoding.html) explains encoding really well.
* **Select algorithm**
* **See classification report**: If selected No, only the accuracy/error of the algorithm will be displayed in the main window after the Run button is pressed. Otherwise, a new window will be opened, containing the following information:
  * Classifier accuracy
  * Null accuracy: This is the accuracy you would obtain if you always predicted the most frequently occurred value in your target class. Suppose your dataset has 100 rows and your target class has two unique values, *Free* and *Paid*, occupying 70 and 30 rows respectively. If you always predict *Free*, you will be right 70/100 times.
  * Cross validated: Whether 10 fold cross validation was used to evaluate your model or not
  * Confusion matrix
  * Classification report containing precision, recall, f1-score and support of your model
  * Time taken

With cross validation off, you will also get feature importance if you pick a tree based classifier. If your target class is binary, an ROC curve will also be generated.

* **Perform cross validation**: Yes means 10 fold cross validation is used to evaluate your model. No means a train - test ratio of 67:33 is used instead.
* **Try every possible feature combination**: This runs your chosen algorithm on all possible combinations of the columns in your dataset. For instance, if your dataset has three columns - A, B and C, then the algorithm will be executed 7 times on the following column combinations - (A,B,C), (A,B), (A,C), (B,C), (A), (B), (C). Note that the live results for each iteration will be displayed in the console of your IDE which includes:
  * Best score and corresponding feature set
  * Current score and corresponding feature set
* **Drop columns manually**: If you want to drop columns manually, you need to select Yes before opening a file.
* **Feature selector**: Finds the most important features in your dataset



## Buttons
* **Open File**: Only CSV files are supported.
* **Run**: Executes the selected algorithm on the dataset opened.
* **Export CSV**: Generates an encoded version of the file (based on the values of the first three fields) in the directory from which it was opened.

## Data Summary
![Data Summary:](https://github.com/mastermueez/ML-for-Dummies/blob/master/Pics/DataSummary.png)
This option appears once a file has been opened. It contains the following information of your dataset:
* **Total column count**
* **Total row count**
* **Null row count**: The number of rows with a missing value in at least one corresponding cell
* **All column names** followed by:
  * The percentage of missing values
  * Number of unique values (null is considered a unique value)
You cannot stop this operation until all possible combinations have been explored. When that happens a window presenting the best features and the best score will pop up.
* **Bar chart**: Generates an ordered bar chart of the chosen column
* **Histogram**: Only numerical options are shown. Hence, it may be a useful tool to identify which columns will need encoding.
* **Scatter Plot**: Allows visualisation of the correlation between any two numeric columns
